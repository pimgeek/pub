# Thinking with Flying Logic

## Part I — Introduction

### About This Book

**Flying Logic** is software that helps people improve. This book, Thinking with Flying Logic, introduces the core techniques that the Flying Logic was designed to support. Even if you don’t use Flying Logic, I hope you will find it a concise and useful introduction to some powerful ways you can improve your business and personal life.

Thinking with Flying Logic is companion to two other documents: Welcome to Flying Logic explains why Flying Logic exists, and the Flying Logic User’s Guide explains the details of operating it. To use a travel analogy, Welcome to Flying Logic hopefully got you interested in taking a trip, the Flying Logic User’s Guide taught you how to drive the car, and Thinking with Flying Logic is the road map you will follow to get you where you want to go.

However, Thinking with Flying Logic is not an exhaustive tutorial on the techniques it discusses— in fact, it barely scratches the surface. In particular, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and the TOC Thinking Processes that inspired the creation of Flying Logic are supported by a wealth of literature, books, papers, web sites, courses, conferences, consultants, trainers, academics, implementors, studies, and success stories. I believe that Flying Logic is a much-needed piece of the puzzle, and I urge anyone who reads this book to seek out these other great resources as well, some of which are listed in the Appendix.
