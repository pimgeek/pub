## Part I — Introduction

### About This Book

**Flying Logic** is software that *helps people improve*. This book, *Thinking with Flying Logic*, introduces the core techniques that the Flying Logic was designed to support. Even if you don’t use Flying Logic, I hope you will find it a concise and useful introduction to some powerful ways you can improve your business and personal life.

*Thinking with Flying Logic* is companion to two other documents: *Welcome to Flying Logic* explains why Flying Logic exists, and the *Flying Logic User’s Guide* explains the details of operating it. To use a travel analogy, Welcome to Flying Logic hopefully got you interested in taking a trip, the *Flying Logic User’s Guide* taught you how to drive the car, and *Thinking with Flying Logic* is the road map you will follow to get you where you want to go.

However, *Thinking with Flying Logic* is not an exhaustive tutorial on the techniques it discusses— in fact, it barely scratches the surface. In particular, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and the TOC Thinking Processes that inspired the creation of Flying Logic are supported by a wealth of literature, books, papers, web sites, courses, conferences, consultants, trainers, academics, implementors, studies, and success stories. I believe that Flying Logic is a much-needed piece of the puzzle, and I urge anyone who reads this book to seek out these other great resources as well, some of which are listed in the Appendix.

### Keys to Great Thinking

Most of this book is spent on the step-by-step instructions for working with each of the techniques it presents, but in this introduction I want to briefly touch on some ideas, attitudes, and behaviors that I have found create a mind set conducive to effective thinking and communication— these are the ultimate keys to effective use of Flying Logic.

#### Logic and Emotion

“Logic” is popularly seen as a cold, complex topic; on par with higher mathematics and invoking images of nerdy professors, science fiction computers and emotionless aliens. But the fact remains that we all think, and we all use logic with more or less skill.

What is not widely understood is that logic is simply the *rules for thinking*. Just as it is possible (though perilous) to drive a car without knowing the rules of the road, it is possible to think without understanding the rules of logic. These rules are extremely powerful, and fortunately quite simple— but it is unfortunate that as children we are rarely taught to use them as naturally as we learn to read and write. And far from turning us into dispassionate machines, we humans are naturally the happiest and most productive when our emotional hearts and logical minds work together in concert.

Some people resist “being logical” on the grounds that they “just know how they feel” on a given subject. But when we experience strong emotions or gut instincts, it is important to recognize that there are always underlying causes for those feelings. If we merely acknowledge the resulting feelings, and resist a deeper understanding of the causes, we create a disconnect between the rational and emotive parts of our minds. This disconnect results in *cognitive dissonance*, which is stress resulting from attempting to believe conflicting things or behave in conflicting ways. Cognitive dissonance is a two-edged sword: on the one hand it can help motivate us to change our beliefs for the better (that is, to better reflect reality) while on the other hand it can also lead us to manufacture *rationalizations* for the way we feel that don’t reflect reality. While both actions quell the discomfort of cognitive dissonance in the short term, rationalizing ultimately leads us deeper into trouble by putting us further and further out of sync with reality.

Attempting to act on feelings alone has another drawback: such actions leave us vulnerable to unintended consequences that our rational minds could have helped us predict and avoid. Of course, it works the other way too: if we try to be “purely rational,” yet ignore strong feelings *by discounting their causes*, we are also going to create dissonance.

The solution is to get in the habit of bringing the causes (or reasons) that underlie our emotions and instincts to the surface. In doing so, we validate our emotions, and can then integrate them into effective plans. 

The good news is that thinking is a *learnable skill* that improves with practice, and that doing so does not diminish, but rather *complements* the value of emotions.

#### Communication and Criticism

We can rarely accomplish anything of significance alone: we rely on other people for many kinds of contributions, and since no one is an island, we must communicate effectively with others— to gain an understanding of their needs, benefit from their experience and wisdom, and negotiate their cooperation.

Often, we are too close to a situation to understand it well— we are embroiled in the situational details and “can’t see the forest for the trees.” When we think we understand a situation well; when we think we already know the all the options and the right answers— this is when inviting others to evaluate and criticize our plans can be the most valuable. Doing so lets “light and air” into our minds and helps us rid ourselves of ways of thinking that have become stale and unproductive.

In *The Godfather Part II*, Michael Corleone says, “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” Ironically, the most fruitful criticism often comes from people who actively disagree with us. Abraham Lincoln, arguably the greatest United States President, is renowned for having chosen prominent members of his cabinet from those who most vehemently opposed his policies. Whether or not we ultimately agree with our critics, they can often teach us a great deal— the key is to allow our view of the world to change as we learn.

#### Argument and Honor

When we think of an argument, many of us envision scowls, angry gesticulation, and yelling. We imagine petty name-calling, a parade of unforgiven grievances, and other emotional power plays. Most importantly, we imagine arguing to *get our way*— to show that we are *right* and others are *wrong*. But such an interaction is not an argument— it is a *fight*. In a fight there may be winners, but there will certainly be losers, and injuries for all.

A real argument is a *shared search for truth*. In an honorable argument people can still be passionate, but they follow the rules of logic just as drivers follow the rules of the road. And even though people approach a situation from different perspectives and with different preconceptions, the positions they take should be seen as suggestions that are *ultimately intended* as win-win, even if they initially fall far short. Indeed, even such flat statements as, “We’ll get along fine as soon as you learn to do things my way,” hint at a common objective: *getting along*.

When argument is viewed as a search for truth, it becomes possible to see adapting one’s position to new information and ideas not as weak or wishy-washy, but as a challenge to which only a mature, strong, and honorable person can rise. More pragmatically, all sides can begin to look forward to not merely *getting their way*, but *getting something better* in the form of a win-win solution.

#### Control and Influence

When considering how to cause change, we can imagine ourselves standing at the center of a circle. The things we can reach out and touch directly define our *span of control*. If the all changes we wish to make are entirely within our span of control, we have the power to simply go ahead and make them.

Usually, however, things are not so simple. In our mental image, the things we control are just what lies within arm’s reach— our span of control is always quite small. But just beyond our span of control lies the start of our *sphere of influence*. Although we may not be able to reach out and touch these things directly, we can still cause change by cooperating with others. For example, a business may *control* its manufacturing processes, while it can only *influence* its suppliers and customers.

The farther away objects are, the less influence we wield— until we reach a point where we have no significant influence. This marks the end of our sphere of influence.

Our sphere of influence is always much larger than our span of control, and is probably larger than we think. Most gratifyingly: causing positive changes within your sphere of influence has the desirable effect of expanding it.

#### Optimization and Suboptimization

When we reward people for improvements entirely within their span of control, what is the natural reaction? An example of this might be basing manager performance reviews solely on efficiency within their departments. The natural reaction is, of course, for them to narrow their span of control as much as possible— to define its boundaries as sharply from other parts of the system, and to focus entirely on efficiency within their particular component (division, department, cubicle, etc.) This behavior results in *suboptimization*, which is maximizing or fine-tuning a part of the system without considering the (often detrimental) effects of doing so on the entire system.

On the other hand, what happens when we reward people for improvements within their entire *sphere of influence*? In this case, their desire becomes to extend their sphere of influence outwards as far as possible. As mentioned previously, acting in one’s sphere of influence requires coordination and cooperation with others, which in turn encourages an awareness of the system as a whole. The end result is optimization, where people orchestrate their efforts together, toward the fulfillment of the system’s goal. 

Optimization is the outcome of systems thinking (looking at a system not as merely a collection of parts but as a unified whole) applied to the goal of *process improvement*. 

#### Tools and Expectations 

People have invented many useful tools that help us perceive the world accurately, arrange our knowledge, think about it logically, develop plans, and communicate effectively. Despite having these tools, we must still do the hard work of thinking, and also the hard work of implementing our plans. When new tools (such as Flying Logic) are introduced, they are often touted as labor-saving devices. But do we really do *less* work now that we have automobiles, telephones, and computers? Arguably, in our world of accelerating change, we often do *more*. So it is important to have a pragmatic understanding that the net result of new tools is not to *reduce labor, but to raise expectations*. 

Just as spreadsheets were a boon to accounting and financial planning but did not make accountants obsolete, I hope that Flying Logic will be of significant help to systems thinkers and people with a passion for making the world and its systems better. Even more, it is my hope that Flying Logic will help get more people involved in these vital topics.

## Part II — The Theory of Constraints Thinking Processes

### Overview of the Theory of Constraints

#### The Goal

The [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints) (TOC) is an overall management philosophy originally developed by [Eliyahu M. (“Eli”) Goldratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt) and first popularized in his bestselling business novel [The Goal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_%28novel%29). He started with the idea that all real-world **systems**; whether personal, interpersonal, or organizational have a primary purpose, or **goal**. The rate at which the system accomplishes its goal is called **throughput**.

#### The Constraint

From the idea of throughput, it is easy to see that systems must also have at least one **constraint**: something that limits the system’s throughput, which can be likened to a chain’s weakest link. If a system had absolutely no constraints, it would be capable of infinite throughput. But though infinite throughput is impossible, amazing throughput gains are possible through the careful identification and management of a system’s key constraints. The purpose of the TOC then, is to give individuals and organizations the tools they need to manage their constraints in the most effective manner possible. 

Originally applied to industrial manufacturing lines, TOC principles have been successfully adapted for areas as diverse as supply chain, finance, project management, health care, military planning, software engineering, and strategy. 

TOC claims that a real-world system with more than three constraints is extremely unlikely, and in fact usually only one constraint is key. Counter-intuitively, this is because the *more* complex a system becomes, the *more* interrelationships are necessary among its parts, which results in fewer overall degrees of freedom. 

A major implication of this is that managing a complex system or organization can be made both simpler and more effective by providing managers with few, specific, yet *highly influential* areas on which to focus — maximizing performance in the areas of key constraints, or **elevating** the constraint (making it less constraining.) 

The TOC was originally applied to manufacturing operations, where the constraint was usually a **physical constraint**— some sort of machine or process that formed a bottleneck in the production line. These sort of constraints are fairly easy to locate. But in the real-world situations where these constraints were **broken** (i.e. elevated to the point where they were no longer *the* constraint) it was discovered that the constraints could take on another character: the **policy constraint**. These are the “ways things have always been done” that ultimately serve to restrict the system’s throughput, and they are usually due to some form of **suboptimization**— tuning part of a system without regard to the benefit of the whole. Policy constraints are often more difficult to identify and more difficult to manage than a simple machine or physical process— more powerful tools were invented to do just that.

#### The Five Focusing Steps

To identify and manage constraints of all kinds, the developers of TOC defined the **Five Focusing Steps**, which describe a process of ongoing improvement. (Step Zero was later added for additional clarity.)

0. **Articulate** the goal of the system. *How do we measure the system’s success?* 
1. **Identify** the constraint. *What is the resource limiting the system from attaining more of its goal?* 
2. **Exploit** the constraint to its fullest. *How can we keep the constraining resource as busy as possible, exclusively on what it can do that adds the most value to the entire system?* 
3. **Subordinate** all other processes to the decisions made in Step 2. *How can we align all processes so they give the constraining resource everything it needs?* 
4. **Elevate** the constraint. *If managing the constraining resource more efficiently does not give us all the improvement we need, then how can we acquire more of the resource?* 
5. **Avoid inertia**. *Has the constraint moved to some other resource as a result of the previous steps? If so, don’t allow inertia itself to become the constraint: go back to step 1.*

It is possible that, after iterating through the Five Focusing Steps a few times, that the constraint on the system’s throughput moves entirely out of the system itself, and into the system’s environment. An example of this would be when a manufacturer has more capacity than demand for its products. In this case, further improvement may still be possible, but doing so requires expanding the concept of the “system” to include its customers, the economy, and other factors that were originally just givens of the system’s environment.

#### The Thinking Processes

**The Thinking Processes** emerged as TOC practitioners worked with organizations that needed to identify their core constraints and how to manage or elevate them. They needed the answers to three deceptively simple questions: 
* **What** to change? 
* **To what** to change? 
* **How to cause** the change?

The Thinking Processes are based on the scientific method, to which is added a simple visual language, the **Thinking Process Diagrams**, that are used for describing and reasoning about situations, arguments, and plans using the language of **Cause and Effect**. There are two basic kinds of reasoning: **Sufficient Cause** and **Necessary Condition**.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183418899.png)

**A sufficient cause for an effect**

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183445876.png)

**A necessary condition for an effect**

#### The Thinking Process Tools

From the basic Thinking Processes developed several techniques called the **Thinking Process Tools** designed to answer the three questions. The tools provide the ability to develop a complete picture of a system’s core constraints and how to manage them.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183515916.png)

The last of these tools— the **Strategy & Tactics Tree**, is used in large organizations where it is necessary to create major changes in a short period of time. However, the other five tools are applicable to systems of any size from individuals, to families, to businesses small and large. Like a physical tool kit, you can choose to use individual tools— just the right tool for the job at hand. Or, you can do a larger project where most or all of the tools may be required. When all of the tools are used, the “finished result” of one tool can easily be used as part of the “raw materials” for the next tool. Since improvement is a continuous process, you can use each tool over and over again on every pass through the Five Focusing Steps.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183528119.png)

#### The Measurement of Success

The last piece of the improvement puzzle is *feedback*. There needs to be an unambiguous way to measure improvements brought about through the implemented changes. For traditional business, Dr. Goldratt developed three *non-traditional* measurements that began with the overriding concept of the system’s *goal*: **Throughput** (T), **Inventory** (I), and **Operating Expense** (OE). It is outside the scope of this book to discuss these in detail, but readers are directed to the TOC body of knowledge (see the Appendix) for discussions of these measures and how they have been adapted for many different endeavors.

### The Categories of Legitimate Reservation

We all want our ideas and plans to make sense. But how do we *know* that we are making sense? What do we even mean by that? When we use the **Thinking Process Tools**, we are building a model of the way part of the world works, and in this context our model *makes sense* if it in does in fact portray a picture of the world that is *pertinent* and *accurate*. 

To be *pertinent*, our model must be of that part of the world (our system) that we actually care about— in other words our model must have the proper scope. It must not be too detailed in areas that don’t significantly affect the outcome, nor too general— glossing over areas where important details lie. To ensure pertinence, the people who are the main stakeholders in the outcome of the plan must have influence over it. 

To be *accurate*, the cause-and-effect relationships that we model must indeed hold in real life. The **Categories of Legitimate Reservation** (CLR) are ways to verify the accuracy of a **Thinking Process Diagram**. They are used to catch common pitfalls in our own thinking and the thinking of others. They are called the *Categories* because they are welldefined and of limited number. They are called *Legitimate* because anyone who writes or reads logical statements is always allowed to express them. And they are *Reservations* because they highlight parts of the diagram that are not completely convincing. Since these reservations are *always legitimate*, they can be raised, explored, understood, and accepted without anyone feeling like they’re having their toes stepped on— they help everyone keep their emotional distance and stay reasonable. When you start to work with Thinking Process diagrams, you should deliberately consider the CLR one by one for each part of your diagram. But as you gain experience you will find you begin to apply them quickly and habitually.

#### Clarity

If you are creating a Thinking Process diagram by yourself, you probably have a good idea of what you mean. However, you will also probably need to share your plan with someone else sooner or later, and you need to apply the Clarity reservation as the last step before you do. Ask yourself: 
* Is the meaning of each part of my diagram clear? 
* Is the meaning of my diagram as a whole clear?

Similarly, when someone presents you with a Thinking Process diagram you have never seen before, you should apply the Clarity reservation first by asking yourself: 
* Does this diagram really convey what the person presenting it intends?

In Thinking Process diagrams, causes and effects are all represented by **entities**: rectangles that contain brief statements that are, or could be, true about reality. Flying Logic entities also have a colored bar at the top that designates the entity’s **class**— the kind of role the entity plays in the diagram of which it is part.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183541069.png)

To satisfy the clarity reservation, the **title** of an entity must be: 
* complete, unambiguous, and grammatically correct, 
* in the present-tense, and 
* *simple* in that it contains a single idea with no compound statements. “Bumped and glass fell and broke,” is an example of a statement that violates all three principles. This idea should probably be expressed as three separate entities, each related to the next by a causal connection:

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183546490.png)

The causal connections between the entities must also be clear, with each step from entity to entity having a natural and obvious flow for any stakeholder who reads the diagram. Reading from one entity to another via an **edge** (also called an **arrow**) will follow one of two patterns, or **Thinking Processes**. Which Thinking Process is used depends on what kind of diagram you are working with; but within a single diagram, the meaning of the edges does not change. 
* **Sufficient Cause Thinking**: “If **A** then **B**.” or “**A** is sufficient to cause **B**.”

This pattern expresses the idea that the existence of **A** is, by itself, enough to cause the existence of **B**. Sufficient Cause Thinking is used by the **Current Reality Tree**, **Future Reality Tree**, and **Transition Tree**.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183555935.png)

* **Necessary Condition Thinking**: “If not **A** then not **B**.” or “**A** is necessary to obtain **B**.”

These patterns express that **A** must exist for **B** to exist, but may not be sufficient by itself. Necessary Condition Thinking is used by the **Evaporating Cloud** and **Prerequisite Tree**.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183602032.png)

Notice that in both illustrations, the edge (arrow) looks exactly the same although the meaning is different. How you read an edge depends on which Thinking Process was used to construct the diagram.

#### Entity Existence

This reservation asks whether an entity in the diagram *is true now*. In a Current Reality Tree, for instance, every entity in it should describe something that *is true now*. A Future Reality Tree or Transition Tree, however, can contain a mix of entities that are either true now, or would be expected to become true under certain conditions. This reservation is a warning to “check the facts” before making an untrue assertion about reality.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183608244.png)

#### Causality Existence/Cause-Effect Reversal

This reservation asks, “Does **A** really cause **B**?” Often we associate two ideas because they are *correlated*, that is, they are often found in proximity to each other. However, to actually say that one thing causes another requires much stronger evidence.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183613250.png)

#### Indirect Effects

Other times, an entity is an **indirect effect** of a cause, but important necessary steps are missing.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183620443.png)

#### Cause-Effect Reversal

A special case of the Causality Existence reservation is **Cause-Effect Reversal**. In this case, we question whether the edge is pointed in the right direction.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183625264.png)

#### Back Edges

In cases where it seems ambiguous as to which entity is the cause and which is the effect, it may be a good place to look for a self-reinforcing loop. Flying Logic can model self-reinforcing loops using **back edges**. A back edge is added whenever you attempt to create a new edges that indirectly makes an effect to be its own cause. Back edges are drawn thicker than regular edges.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183631380.png)

#### Insufficient Cause

This reservation asks, “Is **A**, all by itself, sufficient to cause **B**? What else might also be necessary?” Usually a combination of factors outside our control (“Preconditions”) and factors that we influence or control (“Actions”) must combine to create a particular effect. In diagrams based on Sufficient Cause Thinking, this is modeled using a **junctor** that contains the **AND** operator. Junctors are easily created by dragging from an entity to an existing edge.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183139554.png)

When looking for insufficient causes, we should also keep in mind that a list of causes can also be *too sufficient*, or in other words, include causes that are actually not required to produce the effect. So we should also ask, “Have we listed anything as necessary that really isn’t?”

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183641106.png)

#### Additional Cause

Once we have identified one sufficient cause for an effect, we are often tempted to move on, and in doing so we may overlook other causes that may either be independently causing the effect, or mutually intensifying it. This reservation asks, “Have we identified every cause of **A**? What else could also be causing **A**?”

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183645838.png)

#### Predicted Effect

How can we increase our certainty that a cause we have identified is really the cause of the effects we are inclined to believe? For example, let’s say I come from a walk and discover my wallet missing. One of the first things that might pass though my mind is that my house has been robbed. But has it been robbed?

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183650927.png)

Usually a cause is responsible for more than one effect, and this reser- vation asks, “If **A** is true, what other effects in addition to **B** would we expect to see?”

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183655009.png)

If the additional predicted effects are also observed, then we can be more confident in the causality we initially identified. But if the predicted effects are **not** observed, then we may be well advised to look for additional causes.

![mark](http://pimfans.hintsnet.com/blog/20170411/183659901.png)

#### Tautology

People sometimes don’t examine their beliefs very closely, and will, when asked for a cause, often re-state the cause using different words. Even though you will almost never encounter tautology (also called **circular reasoning or begging the question**) in a Thinking Process diagram, you will encounter it in casual conversation. Some examples:

* “You can’t give me a C for this course— I’m an A student!” 
* “My homework is boring because it’s so tedious.” 
* “Mayor Green is the most successful mayor ever because he’s the best mayor in our history.” 
* “The defendant shows no remorse, and this fact should strengthen your resolve to find him guilty!”
